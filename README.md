Workshop slides for my presentation at the TransTech Summit 2023.

Title:

"Create your stunning web portfolio for job hunting and freelance services with Quarto (no coding required)"


#1 Takeaway:

A portfolio is a collection of highlighted projects and previous works that show potential clients or employers your abilities. With this workshop, you will acquire the skills for creating and publishing an elegant portfolio that you can customize according to your needs. You will learn how to use Quarto to achieve a professional-looking website for free, and without having to worry too much about technical details.


Who is this presentation for?

Anyone who wants to make an attractive web portfolio to showcase their work experience, skills, and/or promote their services. This talk is aimed at tech and non-tech people who want to take advantage of this open source tool that is free, easy to use and maintain, and does not require coding nor paid hosting. No programming skills are needed; however, familiarity with markup languages, and with the VSCode user interface will be helpful.
